Software Architecture Document

# 1.Introduction

## 1.1Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the system, using a number of different architectural views to depict different aspects of the system. It is intended to capture and convey the significant architectural decisions which have been made on the system.

## 1.3Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

## 1.4References

## 1.5Overview

# 2.Architectural Representation

Model-View-Controller pattern

# 3.Architectural Goals and Constraints

Goal is to apply the MVC pattern to our project. Since we are using Unity we do not have an external MVC framework but we use the Unity architecture which is similar to MVC. The differce is, that the view and the controller classes are not clearly divided.
